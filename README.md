# --- About Me --- #
Hi, I am a game developer, sound engineer and a composer.
I have been developing games for the past 6 months and have been composing music for the past 8 months.
I make sound effects for video games. I love to use Audacity for all my sound work, and I have been using it for about a year now.

Follow me on all my social media platforms to stay up to date.
